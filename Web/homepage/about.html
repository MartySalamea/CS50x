            <p>I’m a digital product designer and full-stack JavaScript developer with six years of experience working with startups, tech companies and government.</p>
            <p>I love fostering creative teams, shipping desirable products, promoting design thinking and working with a wide range of companies and industries to experience more of the world.</p>
            <p>I’ve had the pleasure of working with great companies such as Google, Palantir, Canva and Westfield; as well as disruptive startups in self-driving car technology (Baraja), sustainable energy financing (Brighte), 3D biotechnology (Inventia), enterprise-grade cybersecurity (UpGuard) and artificial intelligence (Faethm). I’ve also been fortunate enough to assist the Australian government’s data science and research division, CSIRO Data61.</p>
            <p>Before starting Jellypepper, I was Head of Product and Design at Spaceship. I helped the company launch their superannuation product, grow from $0 to $100m in FUM and raise more than $20m from Sequoia, NEA, Valar, Blackbird and AirTree. I also created Presumi —  a resume-tracking and analytics platform for online employment marketplaces. It used a unique algorithm that allowed for detailed resume tracking all the way from the candidate to the employer and back again.</p>
            <p>I studied at the University of Technology, Sydney where I graduated with two Bachelor degrees (Science in Information Technology and Business). I also started the Sydney Designers meetup, growing it from 0 to over 2500 members in just over a year.</p>
